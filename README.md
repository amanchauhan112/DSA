# DSA

DSA Practice  I am doing from Final 450 sheet by Love Babbar and GFG,Leetcode.

Whichever answer I find the best I put it here.

## For Recursion

We can approach Recursion question with following ways:

### 1)IBH

Induction : decrease or increase value of input Eg.print(n-1)

Base Condtion : where you want to stop Eg. if(n<0)return;

Hypothesis : the program u want  to do Eg. to print (cout<<n;)

### 2)Recursive Tree

->Input nd Output TREE

## For Graph:

In parameters we are mostly given no. of nodes and a list that contains first node connected to index valued node

For eg. : if 0 connected to 1 2 3 and 2 is connected to 4

adj[0] : 0->1->2->3

then 1 and 3 are leaf node

Node 2 is connected to leaf 4 so adj[2] : 2->4

and adj[1],adj3,adj4:1,3,4 respectively.
